# Line Follower Bot
The Line Follower Bot is an autonomous robotic vehicle that follows a predefined path marked by a contrasting line (usually black on a white surface). It uses infrared (IR) sensors to detect the line and continuously adjust its movement using real-time feedback. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of robotics, control systems, and embedded programming.
